level 2, and I managed to escape the tubes with my marble without meaning to (and I wasn't 
jumping)


level 3: this level is laggy every now and then (I don't know if it's because there are 2 marbles 
or what) I managed to get the pink marble "stuck" between like two pipes, kind of like this, in 
between the two red pieces


edit: I went back, the lag seems to be from it not clearing previous levels, if I force-close the 
game and then go back to it, it gets better (temporarily)

level 5 took me a few tries to jump across, but I did it - and then found no "target ball", so 
when I sent my marble to the "end", I got a "Unfortunately, Marble run has stopped." crash that 
took me back to the main screen


level 6 - I give up, I can't beat this one


level 7 - I missed 1 ball on the 2nd side, and it got "stuck" inside the black space


level 8 - I like the "marble accelerators", but they are a bit rough on the "player-controlled" 
marble, I would perhaps add a lag on the screen's movement and make the control marble move as the 
others do when it hits them - also, this map is huge, and I get "lost", I have no idea how fast I 
am moving, and sometimes the other marbles move WAYYY too fast for me to catch them (OK, that may 
be my fault, as I had some fun shooting the other marbles)


level 9 - easy, and it gives "unable to load level 10" at the end, thus sending me back to level 1
(I think the main menu or level selector would be better)
